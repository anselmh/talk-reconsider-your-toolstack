			<p>A Talk about how to deal with front-end development work today.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>Hi, <strong>I’m Anselm!</strong></p>
			<p>I’m freelancer, front-end developer / architect / troubleshooting specialist, ninja or whatever you prefer these days, dear recruiter.</p>

				<p>No seriously: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>I’m doing front-end work as many others do, maybe with a different focus. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I do the WDRL, a weekly newsletter for you to stay up to date and podcast @workingdraft with Hans each week.</p>
						<pre><code>    *Drawn logos of WDRL, Workingdraft, INIT, ODL, RICG, Nightlybuild*

			<p>Now, what I wanna tell you now. Many of us <strong>are</strong> struggling and are <a href="wesbos.com/overwhelmed-with-web-development/">overwhelmed by technologies</a> choice and its lifecycles.</p>
			<p>Every day there are new tools, frameworks, libraries. </p>
			<p>Every month there is a new CSS or JS coding guideline you should follow.</p>
			<p>It’s easy to feel behind because you, like me, have a normal day to day job or even have a more regular job than I, because I really have a diverse freelance job switching between many topics each day. Anyway, that’s not an issue and in fact you’re part of the majority if you are a regular worker in a company.</p>

			<p>The Social Media Bubble</p>
			<p>And while you probably read what the awesome people do on Twitter: They’re just a small little part of our industry. Don’t forget what so many other people do that you don’t hear of.</p>
			<p>I’ve seen great developers and awesome code when I worked in some projects that could easily fill a Hackernews Top10 place. But people never wrote up and just did their fucking job.</p>
			<pre><code>            *Sketch the Twitter bubble*
				</code></pre>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>But what if… ?</p>
			<p>The whole Open Source / Twitter bubble doesn’t agree on one thing? Angular is not cool anymore, now you use React, but what is it tomorrow? Do you even need React? Didn’t you just wanted to create a normal website for a small to mid-sized client?</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>Be cool and have a bird eye view on it.</p>
			<pre><code>        *Sketch of a bird eye*
			</code></pre>
			<p>If you have too much time and wanna play around with something new even if you don’t need it, go ahead. Try React, Broccoli, incremental DOM, Polymer, etc.</p>
			<p>If not, watch it with some popcorn and concentrate on the more important parts.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>How to keep track of the relevant things?</p>
			<p>Of course some shameless self promotion:</p>
			<pre><code>        *WDRL Logo sketched*
			</code></pre>
			<p>Well, the truth is: Read summaries, wait at least 3 months before digging into a new tool. Most die within. The few surviving might be relevant for you.</p>
			<p>Then: Go to conferences like these. </p>
			<p>Listen to Hans’ talk later on, he’s telling you how to use the cool stuff that’s stable and brings you forward.</p>

		<section>
			<p>Let’s do a deep dive…</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Yo, don’t you use the CLI? Uncool, dude!</p>
			<pre><code>        *Show an interactive terminal output typing fast git commands and npm commands*
			</code></pre>
			<hr>
			<p>Yo, don’t you use Gulp?</p>
			<pre><code>        *Show a not so helpful gulp error in the CLI*
					*Show dependency graph of a typical Gulp tasks*
					*Show time of a gulp task*
			</code></pre>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>Yo, it’s dependency management time?</p>
			<pre><code>            *Bower is uncool*
						*npm is great, show issues with private modules, private repos*
						*Oh fuck, github/npm is down, nothing works anymore*
						*And what about composer? I’m using some CMS, too.*
			</code></pre>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>Use the tools that fit best to you.</p>
			<pre><code>            *It doesn’t help anyone if you can’t deal with the tool properly*
						*It makes no sense if your company’s policy or technical setup doesn’t work with the tool*
						*You’re not going to be productive when you’re not comfortable with your tools*
			</code></pre>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>&lt;&lt;= Rewind!</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>Why the fuck did I start with tools? That’s wrong.</p>
			<p>Here we go again.</p>
			<pre><code>        *Power Off Icon*, then:
					*Drawn Rewind icon*
			</code></pre>
			<p>Sorry, in pure fascination on all the tooling stuff – yes, it really excites me – I forgot to tell you the most important part.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>Concepts before Tools</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<ul>
				<li>Take some time for project management</li>
				<li>Take more time for a technical concept and breakdown of the project</li>
				<li><em>Optional</em>: If you’re in a team, discuss this now and approve the concept with the team.</li>
				<li>Take time to figure out the type of tools you need</li>
				<li>Now, get yourself the tools you’re comfortable with</li>
				<li>Start working!</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Thank you!</p>
			<p>Have fun and enjoy the event!</p>
